I took Apple's AVCam example and reduced the code to the bare min.
Note that this still does blink and smile detection. If you don't want that you can change the face detection accuracy to low which will be faster.

This does not show video or draw boxes on a video (like AVCam does).

It simply displays the first face it detects, over and over.
